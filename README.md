This is a maze ganerator
It uses OpenCV for generating the grid using wall 

Used concept of class in python to create a cell class and kept them stored in a linear array called grid, this reduces the no of iteration 
and used indexes to store the exact position of cells in grid. 


**Algorithm**
\\ Recusrsive Bactracking \\
It starts with a random cell and picks a random neighbour if its not visited and remove the wall 
It iterates all through the grid and creates the maze 

Uses two canavs , one to show the wall removal iterative process and another to output the maze

I will keep updating different algorithms to create mazes
