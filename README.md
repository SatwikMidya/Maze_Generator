This is a maze ganerator
It uses OpenCV for generating the grid using wall 


**Algorithm**
\\ Recusrsive Bactracking \\
It starts with a random cell and picks a random neighbour if its not visited and remove the wall 
It iterates all through the grid and creates the maze

I will keep updating different algorithms to create mazes
